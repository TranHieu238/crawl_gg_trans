"After 40 years, he passed away, and left her a letter which said:"
"“My dearest, please forgive me, forgive my life’s lie."
This was the only lie I said to you – the salty coffee.
Remember the first time we dated?
"I was so nervous at that time, actually I wanted some sugar, but I said salt, it was hard for me to change so I just went ahead."
I never thought that would be the start of my biggest lie.
"I tried to tell you the truth many times in my life, but I was too afraid to, as I had promised never to lie to you."
"Now I’m dying, and afraid of nothing so I will tell you the truth: I don’t like salty coffee, what a strange bad taste!"
"My mother is a person I admire most. She devoted a lot of time and energy to the upbringing of my two brothers and 1. Despite working hard, she always made time to teach us many useful things which are necessary and important in our later lives. Moreover, she is a good role model for me to follow. She always tries to get on well with people who live next door and help everyone when they are in difficulties, so most of them respect and love her. I admire and look up to my mother because she not only brings me up well but also stands by me and gives some help if necessary. For example, when I encounter some difficulties, she will give me some precious advice to help me solve those problems. She has a major influence on me and 1 hope that I will inherit some of her traits."
"My first visit to Nha Trang, the coastal city, was three years ago. It was a pleasant and memorable trip. Nha Trang, the capital of Khanhs Hoaf province, has one of the most popular municipal beaches in all of Vietnam. In Nha Trang, nature beauties are so tempting. Waves crashing onto the cliffs; the soft sigh of the sea breeze; clean white sands and turquoise waters; it all makes for a stunning landscapes. On my visit to Nha Trang, I used to get up early each morning to stroll along the beach a chance to breath in the fresh sea air and enjoy the sunrise across the water. One attraction that captivated me three years ago and still it does is the collection of small offshore islands. Hon Tre is the largest of the islands, and Monkey island is, as the name suggests, the home of hundreds of wild monkeys. Yen island is known for its swifts’ nests. Nha Trang is the city in hamoney: its fine weather, favorite position and friendly people bring it a cerain balance. Nha Trang is a great holiday destination. I hope to have chance to come back."
"My favorite subject is English. The first reason I like this subject is that it is a core subject which is vital and essential in my career path. I try to learn this international language well so that I can communicate with foreigners and find a good job in the future. Fur- thermore, learning English well can help me read books or magazines in English. Through reading things in English, I can be exposed to various cultures and customs. Besides, my English teacher is a dedicated person who can engage me in her lessons and bring the passion for me. I found her lessons interesting be- cause she delivered them in a way that I really liked. In short, English is an important subject which I am really keen on."
"Amidst the immense mountains and forests of Lam Dong province, Dalat, a beautiful town, captivates all those who have been there once. I am one of those. Dalat is often called the City of Eternal Spring. Flowers of all colors, with many species, the most numerous of which are orchids. More than anywhere else in Viet- nam, Dalat sees flowers vie with one another in blos soming in spring. I used to get up early in the morn- ing on fine days to welcome dawn on the highlands. Opening the windows, I had a breath-taking view of nature, and enjoyed the fragrance of wild flowers car- ried by the clouds, I felt relieved in my heart. In the late afternoons, I often reserved for visits to the Valley of Love and Sigh Lake covered with quiet pine forests. Twilight on Dalat also brought many pictures and sen- sations. The wind rustling through the pine forests, the roar of waterfalls, the chirping of birds and the clatter of horse ‘s hooves….all of these unforgettable memories always remain with me."

"Life in the city is full of activity. Early in the morning hundreds of people rush out of their homes in the manner ants do when their nest is broken. Soon the streets are full of traffic. Shops and offices open, stu- dents flock to their schools and the day’s work begins. The city now throb with activity, and it is full of noise. Hundreds of sight-seers, tourists and others visit many places of interest in the city while businessmen from various parts of the world arrive to transact business. Then towards evening, the offices and day schools begin to close. Many of the shops too close. There is now a rush for buses and other means of transport. Everyone seems to be in a hurry to reach home. The city is described as a place of constant activity. Here, the drama of life is enacted every day."
"There are various reasons why many people think that friendship plays an important role in their life. The most important reason can be that everyone needs at least a friend to share everything regardless of sadness or happiness. For me, I like chatting with my friends about what happened every day and discussing person- al problems. Furthermore, our friends will be ready to help us out of our troubles. They will give us some good advice and support when we are in dificulty. Fi- nally, thanks to friendship, we will have fun and enjoy a meaningful life.

"There are many reasons why we should learn English. Firstly, English is an international language which is spoken by millions of people worldwide. In education, English is the compulsory subject of many school pro- grams. For this reason, if students want to get good results in class, they will have to make every effort to study English well. In addition, most famous universities such as Oxford or Cambridge require stu- dents to use English proficiently. Therefore, learning English is one of the necessary ways to provide more opportunities for them to study overseas. Secondly, learning a foreign language helps learners understand and discover other cultures and customs. For instance, people can read books, magazines and news to learn about various cultures because most of them are writ- ten in English. Finally, learning English can help us communicate effectively with foreigners around the world. In general, English plays an important part in the modern world."
"Personally, I prefer life in the country to that in the city because of several reasons. Firstly, rural areas bring me the peace and comfort, which is beneficial to my health. Living here helps me avoid the noise from vehicles such as motorbikes or cars and traffic jam at the rush hour, which can make me comfortable. Secondly, people in the countryside are very friendly and hospitable. If you live in urban areas, you cannot even know your neighbors. This makes you bored and lonely. Thirdly, the cost of living in the city is higher than that in the country. We can find it difficult to live here permanently because property prices are much higher than ever before, and even the prices of goods have increased dramatically. Finally, life in cities can be extremely stressful for us. Today, there are a lot of problems such as unemployment, crime and poverty that we have to face. Because of the disadvantages of living in the city, I want to live and work in the coun- try."
"There are several reasons why children should go abroad to study. Firstly, they can gain higher academic qualifications when studying overseas because a large number of prestigious universities such as Cambridge or Oxford in the UK provide professional teachers who are experts in their fields and better courses. There- fore, students could have more opportunities to find a well- paid job in their home country or get promoted in their career path after graduation. Secondly, living and studying in other countries may help children learn a foreign language such as English or French, which not only allows them to communicate with na- tives effectively but also helps them understand the cultures of other countries. Finally, if students are sent to foreign countries for their studies, they will be likely to become more mature and independent. Experiencing new things including cultures and customs would be beneficial to their later lives because they learn many useful things. In short, it seems that studying abroad is a good opportunity to help young learners better pre- pare for their future."

Also, televi- sion can entertain us with interesting and exciting pro- grams such as comedy shows or movies. This is one of the best ways to help us relax and have fun after work. Furthermore, TV can make things memorable because it presents information in an effective way. In short, television has many benefits because it is not only a source of information but also a means of entertainment."

When I travel a lot, I can experience many things. such as cultures or customs which make a considerable contribution to my knowledge. Finally, we are more likely to make friends with many people in other places, so we will not feel lonlely and strange when traveling anywhere. In conclusion, traveling plays an essential role in my life."
"Tet is one of the most important festivals in my coun- try. It is a big holiday that celebrates the arrival of spring in Viet Nam every year. It usually lasts about 7 days. There are a lot of popular customs of Vietnam- ese people on Tet holiday. For example, they often visit their relatives, friends and temples. Some people visit the graves of their ancestors in their homeland. Before Tet holiday begins, people decorate their house carefully to have a wonderful time with their family. Furthermore, special Tet food such as Chung cake, steamed sticky rice and boiled chicken can play an im- portant role in Vietnam. Perhaps, Tet is the time when members of family can gather to chat or have meals together. In conclusion, Tet is the essential part in Vietnam."
"Nowadays, the Internet, which has many benefits and some drawbacks, is becoming popular all over the world. For one thing, it can provide a lot of informa- tion and some kinds of entertainment for us. Instead of using the traditional media like newspapers, we can use the Internet to surf webs to get information. When you have free time, you can relaxunwind by listening to music and play games. Furthermore, through the In- ternet we not only keep in touch with friends and family but also share opinions or photos with each other. Beside the advantages, it also has some disad- vantages. It can make us lazy. We only want to use the Internet to get information instead of thinking inde- pendently. In addition, we can waste too much time sitting in front of the computer to read newspapers or play games, which can easily have a negative effect on our eyes. In short, I think the internet will be useful to us if we know to use it effectively."
