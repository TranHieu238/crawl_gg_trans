"The Rocks have received calls from Good Morning America, Fox News and The Tyra Banks Show. The moggy’s mugshot has graced the pages of the London Guardian and British tabloids."
"Despite his strange appearance, Yoda – named after the pointy-eared Star Wars character (pictured below) – is a perfectly normal and affectionate cat and a delight to have around."
His extra ears are thought to be the result of a genetic mutation.
But Yoda’s owners are keeping a close watch on their much-loved pet. They are concerned he could be catnapped because he is so different.
"After 40 years, he passed away, and left her a letter which said:"
"“My dearest, please forgive me, forgive my life’s lie."
This was the only lie I said to you – the salty coffee.
Remember the first time we dated?
"I was so nervous at that time, actually I wanted some sugar, but I said salt, it was hard for me to change so I just went ahead."
I never thought that would be the start of my biggest lie.
"I tried to tell you the truth many times in my life, but I was too afraid to, as I had promised never to lie to you."
"Now I’m dying, and afraid of nothing so I will tell you the truth: I don’t like salty coffee, what a strange bad taste!"
"My mother is a person I admire most. She devoted a lot of time and energy to the upbringing of my two brothers and 1. Despite working hard, she always made time to teach us many useful things which are necessary and important in our later lives. Moreover, she is a good role model for me to follow. She always tries to get on well with people who live next door and help everyone when they are in difficulties, so most of them respect and love her. I admire and look up to my mother because she not only brings me up well but also stands by me and gives some help if necessary. For example, when I encounter some difficulties, she will give me some precious advice to help me solve those problems. She has a major influence on me and 1 hope that I will inherit some of her traits."
"My first visit to Nha Trang, the coastal city, was three years ago. It was a pleasant and memorable trip. Nha Trang, the capital of Khanhs Hoaf province, has one of the most popular municipal beaches in all of Vietnam. In Nha Trang, nature beauties are so tempting. Waves crashing onto the cliffs; the soft sigh of the sea breeze; clean white sands and turquoise waters; it all makes for a stunning landscapes. On my visit to Nha Trang, I used to get up early each morning to stroll along the beach a chance to breath in the fresh sea air and enjoy the sunrise across the water. One attraction that captivated me three years ago and still it does is the collection of small offshore islands. Hon Tre is the largest of the islands, and Monkey island is, as the name suggests, the home of hundreds of wild monkeys. Yen island is known for its swifts’ nests. Nha Trang is the city in hamoney: its fine weather, favorite position and friendly people bring it a cerain balance. Nha Trang is a great holiday destination. I hope to have chance to come back."
"My favorite subject is English. The first reason I like this subject is that it is a core subject which is vital and essential in my career path. I try to learn this international language well so that I can communicate with foreigners and find a good job in the future. Fur- thermore, learning English well can help me read books or magazines in English. Through reading things in English, I can be exposed to various cultures and customs. Besides, my English teacher is a dedicated person who can engage me in her lessons and bring the passion for me. I found her lessons interesting be- cause she delivered them in a way that I really liked. In short, English is an important subject which I am really keen on."
"Amidst the immense mountains and forests of Lam Dong province, Dalat, a beautiful town, captivates all those who have been there once. I am one of those. Dalat is often called the City of Eternal Spring. Flowers of all colors, with many species, the most numerous of which are orchids. More than anywhere else in Viet- nam, Dalat sees flowers vie with one another in blos soming in spring. I used to get up early in the morn- ing on fine days to welcome dawn on the highlands. Opening the windows, I had a breath-taking view of nature, and enjoyed the fragrance of wild flowers car- ried by the clouds, I felt relieved in my heart. In the late afternoons, I often reserved for visits to the Valley of Love and Sigh Lake covered with quiet pine forests. Twilight on Dalat also brought many pictures and sen- sations. The wind rustling through the pine forests, the roar of waterfalls, the chirping of birds and the clatter of horse ‘s hooves….all of these unforgettable memories always remain with me."
"My name is Hoang and I am 18 years old. I was born in Thua Thien Hue province. I have one younger brother. He is still in high school. We fight all the time like Tom and Jerry. My father is working in the social labour office. He has worked there for 30 years. Before that, he was a war soldier. My mother is working in the social insurance office. My parents have been mar- ried for 25 years. We moved to Dong Ha town and we have been living there since 1995. In my early school years, I went to the kindergarten, Ham Nghi primary school, Nguyen Hue secondary school, then Le Loi high school. I like football and music. AC Milan is my favor- ite team. My dream would become a good doctor to cure people."
"Life in the city is full of activity. Early in the morning hundreds of people rush out of their homes in the manner ants do when their nest is broken. Soon the streets are full of traffic. Shops and offices open, stu- dents flock to their schools and the day’s work begins. The city now throb with activity, and it is full of noise. Hundreds of sight-seers, tourists and others visit many places of interest in the city while businessmen from various parts of the world arrive to transact business. Then towards evening, the offices and day schools begin to close. Many of the shops too close. There is now a rush for buses and other means of transport. Everyone seems to be in a hurry to reach home. The city is described as a place of constant activity. Here, the drama of life is enacted every day."
"There are various reasons why many people think that friendship plays an important role in their life. The most important reason can be that everyone needs at least a friend to share everything regardless of sadness or happiness. For me, I like chatting with my friends about what happened every day and discussing person- al problems. Furthermore, our friends will be ready to help us out of our troubles. They will give us some good advice and support when we are in dificulty. Fi- nally, thanks to friendship, we will have fun and enjoy a meaningful life. In conclusion, in my opinion, without friends, life would be dull and boring."
"Of all my friends, Hanh and Mai are my best friends. We are at the same class at the primary school and secondary school. We are also neighbors, so we spend most of our time studying and talking together. Hanh is a beautiful girl with black eyes and an oval face. She is an intelligent student who is always at the top of the class. She likes reading and going to the library whenever she has free time. Mai isn’t as beautiful as Hanh but she has a lovely smile and a good appear- ance. Mai is very sporty. She spends most of her free time playing sports. Mai is a volleyball star of our school. She is also very sociable and has a good sense of humor. Her jokes always make us laugh. I love both of my friends and I always hope our friendship will last forever."
"There are many reasons why we should learn English. Firstly, English is an international language which is spoken by millions of people worldwide. In education, English is the compulsory subject of many school pro- grams. For this reason, if students want to get good results in class, they will have to make every effort to study English well. In addition, most famous universities such as Oxford or Cambridge require stu- dents to use English proficiently. Therefore, learning English is one of the necessary ways to provide more opportunities for them to study overseas. Secondly, learning a foreign language helps learners understand and discover other cultures and customs. For instance, people can read books, magazines and news to learn about various cultures because most of them are writ- ten in English. Finally, learning English can help us communicate effectively with foreigners around the world. In general, English plays an important part in the modern world."
"Personally, I prefer life in the country to that in the city because of several reasons. Firstly, rural areas bring me the peace and comfort, which is beneficial to my health. Living here helps me avoid the noise from vehicles such as motorbikes or cars and traffic jam at the rush hour, which can make me comfortable. Secondly, people in the countryside are very friendly and hospitable. If you live in urban areas, you cannot even know your neighbors. This makes you bored and lonely. Thirdly, the cost of living in the city is higher than that in the country. We can find it difficult to live here permanently because property prices are much higher than ever before, and even the prices of goods have increased dramatically. Finally, life in cities can be extremely stressful for us. Today, there are a lot of problems such as unemployment, crime and poverty that we have to face. Because of the disadvantages of living in the city, I want to live and work in the coun- try."
"There are several reasons why children should go abroad to study. Firstly, they can gain higher academic qualifications when studying overseas because a large number of prestigious universities such as Cambridge or Oxford in the UK provide professional teachers who are experts in their fields and better courses. There- fore, students could have more opportunities to find a well- paid job in their home country or get promoted in their career path after graduation. Secondly, living and studying in other countries may help children learn a foreign language such as English or French, which not only allows them to communicate with na- tives effectively but also helps them understand the cultures of other countries. Finally, if students are sent to foreign countries for their studies, they will be likely to become more mature and independent. Experiencing new things including cultures and customs would be beneficial to their later lives because they learn many useful things. In short, it seems that studying abroad is a good opportunity to help young learners better pre- pare for their future."
"There are several reasons why television is an essential part of our lives. First, television helps us see more of the world and learn useful things because TV pro- grams can provide us with general knowledge about many fileds. For example, we can know and understand different cultures and customs around the world just by staying at home to watch TV programs. Also, televi- sion can entertain us with interesting and exciting pro- grams such as comedy shows or movies. This is one of the best ways to help us relax and have fun after work. Furthermore, TV can make things memorable because it presents information in an effective way. In short, television has many benefits because it is not only a source of information but also a means of entertainment."
"I like traveling very much because of several reasons. First of all, traveling can make me feel relaxed and happy. Enjoying the stunning landscape and spectacu- lar views is one of the best ways to help me get away from stress in my daily life. Second, traveling to far places is a good chance for me to broaden my hori- zons. When I travel a lot, I can experience many things. such as cultures or customs which make a considerable contribution to my knowledge. Finally, we are more likely to make friends with many people in other places, so we will not feel lonlely and strange when traveling anywhere. In conclusion, traveling plays an essential role in my life."
"Tet is one of the most important festivals in my coun- try. It is a big holiday that celebrates the arrival of spring in Viet Nam every year. It usually lasts about 7 days. There are a lot of popular customs of Vietnam- ese people on Tet holiday. For example, they often visit their relatives, friends and temples. Some people visit the graves of their ancestors in their homeland. Before Tet holiday begins, people decorate their house carefully to have a wonderful time with their family. Furthermore, special Tet food such as Chung cake, steamed sticky rice and boiled chicken can play an im- portant role in Vietnam. Perhaps, Tet is the time when members of family can gather to chat or have meals together. In conclusion, Tet is the essential part in Vietnam."
"Nowadays, the Internet, which has many benefits and some drawbacks, is becoming popular all over the world. For one thing, it can provide a lot of informa- tion and some kinds of entertainment for us. Instead of using the traditional media like newspapers, we can use the Internet to surf webs to get information. When you have free time, you can relaxunwind by listening to music and play games. Furthermore, through the In- ternet we not only keep in touch with friends and family but also share opinions or photos with each other. Beside the advantages, it also has some disad- vantages. It can make us lazy. We only want to use the Internet to get information instead of thinking inde- pendently. In addition, we can waste too much time sitting in front of the computer to read newspapers or play games, which can easily have a negative effect on our eyes. In short, I think the internet will be useful to us if we know to use it effectively."
"I am usually in habit of reading books. Addition to books that offer me much useful information, I also like comic book. I like comic by the following reasons. First of all, Comic books bring me a great deal of re- laxation. One of them is Doremon story, which tells many funny short stories about 2 main characters, Doremon and Nobita. The author of that comic creates so many amusing situations among characters that. I can’t help laughing. It’s actually a hard-to-put-down book. It attracts not only children but also adults as me. Another good point of it I want to mention about is creative imagination. I mean children need to have imaginative mindset, which helps them be more active in life. Finally, comic book is worth reading after hard work. It is nice for everyone."
"Of all the interesting freetime activities as well as en- tertainments, I like reading book most because of its good aspects it brings to me. First and foremost, read- ing book not only helps widen my knowledge but also makes me love my life more. As you know reference books provide us with a lot of information of every field of our life. Besides, novels, stories which contain many romantic and touching plots controlling my feel- ing a great deal. Moreover, enjoying books regularly gives me a good habit. Especially, my ability to express words fluently is better and better. Therefore, I will be confident of communicating with others. In short, reading books is my main hobby and I will make best use of its advan- tages to have a happy lifestyle."
"In our life, what also has two sides of it is: the good and the bad. Facebook social network too. One of the other utilities can not deny is the sharing of facebook: Information, images, news, … with speed in seconds. Social networks are easy to use and it offers many benefits to users. It will create conditions conducive to the learning kidney as well as the communication hub in the work of the user. Especially young people, it will bring you a lot of opportunities to develop the ability to search for business learning, earn money to be able to achieve the dream. However, Facebook will affect very bad for those who use it on purpose or not, or the unhealthy purpose. It also can be addictive for those who do not know control myself, when they won too much time using this application. Therefore, bene- ficial or harmful facebook depending on intended use of each person."
"One of the most striking features of the present centu- ry is the progress of science and its effects on almost every aspect of social life. Building on the foundation laid by the predecessors, the scientists of today are carrying their investigation into ever-widening fields of knowledge. The advance of science and technology has brought the different parts of the world into closer touch with one another than ever before. We are able to reach distant lands within a very short time. We are also able to communicate with people far away by means of the telephone and the wireless. The invention of the printing machine has made it possible for us to learn from books and newspapers about people in other lands. Moreover, science which has helped people to secure control over nature. Science is admittedly the dominating intellectual force of the modern age."
"The house we are living in is situated in the suburb of HCM city, within thirty minutes’ drive off the central city. We have lived there for more than twenty years. This is a fairly large house surrounded with a luxuriant garden. My house consists of four bed-rooms, a liv- ing-room, a bathroom with a shower, a dinning-room, a kitchen and a toilet. It is air-conditioned and well-furnished. The living-room is decorated beautiful- ly. Paintings by famous artists are hung on the walls. At night, the color neon lights increase the beauty and coziness of the room. There, on Sundays and holidays my father usually spends his time playing chess or drinking tea with his friends. My mother and my two sisters are diligent and hard-working women. They often keep the house clean and tidy. I love my house very much because it is the place where I was born and have grown up in the education of my father and in the tender loving care of my mother. I have spent my whole childhood in the love and affection of my dear ones with so many sweet memories."
"I was born and have grown up in the country in a small village beside a beautiful river. My village is sur- rounded in a hedge of green bamboos. Most of the houses in the village are built of brick and have red tiled roofs. In the middle of the village there is an old pagoda with high trees around it. On the right of the village flows quietly a clear and blue river. When I was young, I used to swim in the river with my friends. On the left of the village lies the village green where vil- lage meetings are often held by village officials. On this ground covered with soft grass we used to fly kites on windy autumnal evenings. My villagers are very friendly and helpful. They are willing to offer mutual help in any case and always get on with one another harmoniously. I loved his village because that is where I was born, grew up and had the happiest childhood."
"To me, one of my best friends is Nam. Nam is 18 years old. He has black hair, a broad forehead, a straight nose and bright eyes. He is very good-looking. He has a kind heart and is easy to get on with everybody. We have been friends for a very long time. The deeper our mutual understanding becomes the more we feel close- ly attached to each other. Nam and I are keen on learning. We are the best pupils in our class. Nam is always at the top. He is good at every subject, but he never shows pride in his abilities and always tries to learn harder. Nam’s family is not rich enough. His par- ents are retired workers. I like Nam very much because of his honesty and straight forwardness. He is always ready to help his weak friends in their study. In my re- lation with Nam, I have got precious experience: thirst for learning, patience to overcome difficulties, helpful- ness and filial piety."
"Whoever has been to Hue ancient city will always admire the gracefulness of Trang Tien Bridge. Built a long time ago, Trang Tien Bridge is composed of 12 spans joining the left bank to the right bank of the Per- fume River. From far away it looks like white arches emerging from the blue skyline. On bright moonlit nights, standing on the bridge you can see myriads of glitter stars reflecting on the clear and blue waters. The light evening breeze rising from the river caresses your skin and fills your lungs with soft fragrance. All around you are coolness and quietness. In the stillness of the long night you can hear the little waves lapping against the sampans gliding gently below. During the day, howev- er, the sceneries are livelier. Groups of schoolgirls, dressed in white, with conical palm hats on their heads are gracefully walking over the bridge to their Dong Khanh School, talking and laughing merrily. The flaps of their white traditional dress or ao dai are fluttering in the fresh morning breeze just like butterflies’ wings. Tourist will foster sweet recollections of this famous bridge forever once they have visited this romantic city."
"Watching television is one of the activities I like to do in my spare time. I enjoy watching cartoons on Saturday mornings and sports programs on Sunday afternoons. I also watch television during the week after I have fin- ished all my school work. At night, I especially like to watch movies and situation comedies. If I have a lot of homework, I try to arrange my schedule so that I can watch at least one of my favorite shows. Watching televi- sion is not the only activity that I do in my spare time. My other favorite activities are making paper flowers and going shopping with my friends. However, when I have spare time, I spend more time watching television than any other activities. Watching television can help me not only relax but also build me a huge knowledge of the open world."
"Good manners play an important part in maintaining peace in a community. A man who has good manners does not hurt the feelings of others, and therefore he is on good terms with his friends and neighbors and also with others. In this way he helps to keep peace in society. To live well in a society, money alone is not enough. We should also have good manners, for it is human nature to seek friendship; and friendship cannot be bought with money. Friendship with others makes life pleasant and it has to be earned through our own attitude towards others. If we are kind to others, they will be kind to us, and kindness is the es- sence of good manners. If one’s manners are good, one behaves well everywhere, even when one is away from the critical eyes of others. Only such a person can live well in society. It is therefore essential for everyone to cultivate good manners."
"One day, I met a terrible thing. I can still remember the incident very clearly. That night, I was home alone. Suddenly, I heard a strange cry outside the house. It frightened me at once. I heard the cry again, but this time it was not so loud. I now felt certain that a child had been attacked by some person or an animal. I opened the door at the back of the house to find out what it was. As soon as I did so, I saw a small girl with a lot of blood all over her body, lying on the floor. She was still alive; however, I then took her into our house and telephoned to the hospital near by. Soon an ambu- lance arrived and took her to the hospital. I did not know what happened after that. When my parents re- turned, I told them all that had happened. Perhaps this is the story I will never forget."
"A good library is an ocean of information, whose boundaries continue to extend with the endless contribu- tion of the numerous streams of knowledge. Thus, it has a peculiar fascination for scholars, and all those whose thirst for knowledge is instable. The usefulness of librar- ies in the spread of knowledge has been proved through the years. The field of knowledge is so extensive and life is so brief that even the most avid reader can never expect to absorb it all. Those who have a love for knowl- edge, therefore, try to master only a small fraction of it. Even this requires reading of hundreds of books, cheap and expensive, new and old. But few people are able to buy all the books on the subject in which they wish to attain proficiency. It is therefore necessary for them to visit a good library, where they can read a great variety of books on the subject they love. Besides, many old and valuable books on certain subjects are found only in a good library. Even the original manuscript of an author, who died several years ago, can be found in it, some- times. In short, libraries have contributed so much to the extension of knowledge that they have become almost in- dispensable to all literate men."
"The most important day in my life was the day when my parents decided to send me to school. I was then about six years old. I had no thought of ever going to school. Words can hardly describe how sad I felt at the thought of having to go to a school. But everything had been de- cided for me and I had no choice but to go to school. Today, I am older and I am in a secondary school, learn- ing more and more about the world around us. The knowledge that I have gained has enriched my mind and I have a better understanding of human problems. I am also able to speak the English language with some ease, and I know that my knowledge of English will prove of great value in all my future activities. I also know that if I can pass all my examinations, I will some day occupy an important position in some profession. Therefore, when I now think of the day when my parents arrived at the decision to send me to school, I am filled with love for them. That was indeed the most important day in my life, a day which has changed the whole course of my life."
"I think English is very important for modern life. It is mainly through the English language that we gain access to the various sources of knowledge. English is a language which is spoken and understood by many people in most countries of the world. It is, in fact, the most important means of communication among the various countries of the word. Knowledge of new discoveries and inventions in one country is transmitted to other countries through En- glish for the benefit of the world. In this way English helps to spread knowledge and progress. The original writings of great scientists, economists, philosophers, psychologists and others who did not speak and write the English language have all been translated into English. Therefore, one who has a good knowledge of English has access to all the sources of information. Further, as the English language is used by people of different lands and cultures, it has become very rich. It contains so many words, ideas and thoughts that a good knowledge of English enriches the mind and enables one to express oneself well. It also helps one to think better and to understand the people of other lands. It is for all these reasons that I consider English the most important subject in school. For all these reasons, 1 believe that English is an important language for humanity."
"Marketing seems to be the kind of career I would like to choose after i leave from university. I like this work in view of some following reasons. First of all, marketing position is well-paid job. The more you help your compa- ny sell more products, the higher your salary is. Of course, you need to have effective strategies to attract customers. Secondly, Working as a marketer gives me many opportunities of improving my persuading skill and ability to converting idea into words. There is no denial that this kind of job requires different skills, but if you meet these requirements, you will be more and more professional. On the whole, it is simply my hobby. Need- less to say “you will do something best when you like it”."
